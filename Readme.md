## 🚀 How It Works

1. The **server** waits for a connection from a client.
2. The **client** takes two numbers as input and sends them to the server.
3. The server computes the sum and sends it back.
4. The client displays the result.

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- VS Code or any Python IDE (optional but recommended)
- No external libraries needed (uses built-in `socket` module)

## ▶️ Running the Program

### Step 1: Start the Server

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

### Step 2: Run the Client

Open another terminal and run:

```bash
python3 client.py
```

Then input two numbers when prompted:

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 25
Sum received from server: 35
